## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

## Setup Instructions

1. Install the required dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Configure email settings in app.py:
```python
app.config['MAIL_SERVER'] = 'your_smtp_server'
app.config['MAIL_PORT'] = 587
app.config['MAIL_USERNAME'] = 'your_email@example.com'
app.config['MAIL_PASSWORD'] = 'your_app_password'
app.config['MAIL_DEFAULT_SENDER'] = ('System Audit', 'your_email@example.com')
```

3. (Optional) Set your OpenAI API key for enhanced AI analysis:
```python
os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY'] = 'your-openai-api-key'
```

4. Run the application:
```
python app.py
```

5. Access the web interface at http://localhost:5000

## Usage

### Local Audit
1. Log in to the dashboard
2. Click "Run New Audit" to perform a local system audit
3. Review the results in the dashboard
4. Click "Send Report via Email" to send the report to your email

### Remote Audit
1. Navigate to the "Remote Audit" page from the sidebar
2. Enter the SSH connection details for the remote server
3. Run the audit and review the results
4. Send the report via email if desired

## Notes
- The application requires sudo privileges to run the audit script
- For remote audits, the SSH user must have sudo privileges on the remote server
- If not using OpenAI API, the system will fall back to local pattern-based analysis
- Email functionality requires valid SMTP server credentials
